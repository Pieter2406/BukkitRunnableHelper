{"name":"Bukkitrunnablehelper","tagline":"","body":"# BukkitRunnableHelper\r\n\r\nBukkitRunnableHelper is a small collection of interfaces and classes (in java) which makes it easier to schedule tasks in the Bukkit Scheduler. Only a small setup is needed and all your classes in Bukkit which need to be scheduled are easily implemented.\r\n\r\nThe required steps to get this to work are:\r\n\r\n  1. At the start (e.g. onEnable method in JavaPlugin) do: ```PlannableHandler.setPlugin(this);```\r\n  2. Now you have 4 options:\r\n      * ```implements TimeOutable``` (for one-time effects after a certain timeout)\r\n      * ```implements Repeatable``` (for repeated effects until canceled)\r\n      * ```implements TimedRepeatable``` (for repeated effects which cancels after a certain time)\r\n      * ```implements ConditionalRepeatable``` (for repeated effects which cancel after a certain condition is met)\r\n  3. After implementing one of the above interfaces in your class (and implementing the necessary methods), do: ```PlannableHandler.handlePlannable(this)``` in your if you want to schedule the effect.\r\n  \r\n  That's it!\r\n  \r\n  More information can be found on the javadoc page [page](pieter2406.github.io)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
